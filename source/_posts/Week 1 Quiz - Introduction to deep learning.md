1.What does the analogy "AI is the new electricity" refer to?

- [ ] AI is powering personal devices in our homes and offices, similar to electricity. 
- [ ] Through the "smart grid", AI is delivering a new wave electricity. 
- [ ] AI runs on computer and is thus powered by electricity, but it is letting computer do things not possible before. 
- [x] Similar to electricity starting about 100 years ago, AI is transforming multiple industries. 

**Note**: Andrew illustrated the same idea in the lecture. 

2.Which of these are reasons for Deep Learning recently taking off? (Check the two options that apply)

- [x] We have access to a lot more computatonal power. 
- [ ] Neural Networks are a brand new field. 
- [x] We have access to a lot more data. 
- [ ] Deep learning has resulted in significant improvements in important applications such as online advertising, speech recognition, and image recognition. 

3.Recall this diagram of iterating over different ML ideas. Which of the statements below are true? (Check all that apply)

- [x] Being able to try out ideas quickly allows deep learining engineers to literate more quickly. 
- [x] faster computation can help speed up how long a team takes to literate a good idea. 
- [ ] It is faster to train on a big dataset than a small dataset. 
- [x] Recent progress in deep learning algorithms has allowed us to train good models faster (even without changing the CPU/GPU hardware). 

4.When an experienced deep learning engineer works on a new problem, they can usually use insight from previous problems to train a good model on the first try, without needing to iterate multiple times through different models. True/False?

- [ ] True
- [x] False

5.Which one of these plots represents a ReLU activation function?

- [ ] Figure 1:

- [ ] Figure 2:

- [x] Figure 3:

- [ ] Figure 4:

6.Images for a cat recognition is an example of "structured" data, becouse it is represented as a structured array in a computer. True/False?

- [ ] Ture
- [x] False

7.A demographic dataset with statistics on different cities' population, GDP per capita, economic growth is an example of "unstructured" data because it contains data coming from different sources. True/False?

- [ ] True
- [x] False

8.Why is an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) used for machine translation, say translating English to French? (check all that apply)

- [x] It can be trained as a superived learning problem. 
- [ ] It is strictly more powerful than Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 
- [x] It is applicable when the input/output is a sequence (e.g., a sequence of words).
- [ ] RNNs represent the recurrent process of Idea->Code->Experiment->Idea->....

9.In this diagram which we hand-drew in lecture, what do the horizontal axis (x-axis) and the vertical axis (y-axis) represent?

![diagram which we hand-drew in lecture](../../img/1-1-6.png)

- [ ] x-axis is the amount of data, y-axis is the size of the model you train. 
- [x] x-axis is the amount of data, y-axis (vertical axis) is the perfomance of the algorithm. 
- [ ] x-axis is the perfomance of the algorithm, y-axis (vertical axis) is the amount of data. 
- [ ] x-axis is the input to the algorithm, y-axis is the output. 

10.Assuming the trends described in the previous question's figure are accurate (and hope you got the axis right), which of the following are true? (Check all that apply)

- [ ] Decreasing the size of a neural network generally does not hurt an algorithm's performance, and it may help significantly. 
- [x] Increasing the training set size generally does not hurt an algorithm's performance, and it may help significantly. 
- [ ] Decreasing the training set size generally does not hurt an algorithm's performance, and it may help significantly. 
- [x] Increasing the size of a neural network generally does not hurt an algorithm's performance, and it may help significantly.
